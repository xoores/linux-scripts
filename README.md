# linux-scripts

Collection of scripts that I use on my Gentoo machine. I tend to put all scripts in /scripts directory.

It is not likely that you would find these useful "as is" since I did customize my installation quite a bit to my taste.

I will add my scripts gradually as I usually write them in a hurry and since my machine is single-user with FDE I don't really care that much about cleaning those scripts up. I have to comb through them and make sure that they will not contain any private or sensitive information first...

In time I will also put up my .dotfiles & link them as well.
